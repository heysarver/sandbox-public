### Uncle Nick's White Elephant Game Instructions

#### Overview:
Uncle Nick's White Elephant is a fun, interactive game designed for gatherings where participants bring 2 to 4 gag gifts each. The game combines the excitement of chance with the hilarity of surprise gifts, ensuring everyone ends up with at least two presents and possibly more!

#### Preparations:
- **Participants:** All guests.
- **Gifts:** Each person brings 2 to 4 gag gifts, wrapped to conceal their identity.
- **Materials Needed:** A pair of dice.

#### Game Rules:

##### Round 1: The Gift Grab
1. **Formation:** Players sit in a circle with the wrapped gifts placed in the center.
2. **Rolling the Dice:** Players take turns rolling the dice.
3. **Picking a Gift:** When a player rolls a 7 or an 11, they choose a gift from the center but do not open it. Shaking the gift to guess its contents is encouraged!
4. **Continuation:** The dice pass around the circle until all gifts have been picked.

##### Round 2: Sudden Death Steal
1. **Timer Set:** A timer is set for 5 minutes.
2. **Roll for Steals:** Players continue rolling the dice in the same order.
3. **Stealing Gifts:** If a player rolls a 7 or 11, they can steal a gift from another player. Gifts can be stolen multiple times.
4. **End of Round:** The round ends when the timer goes off.

#### Insurance Rule:
- **Guaranteed Gifts:** To ensure everyone gets at least 2 gifts, if a player ends up with less than 2 gifts after the Sudden Death Steal, they can pick one from the extra gifts brought by players who brought more than 2 gifts.
- **Extras as Bonuses:** Any extra gifts after everyone has at least 2 are considered bonus gifts and can be distributed through a final round of rolling or as decided by the group.

#### Final Notes:
- **Gift Opening:** Once the game ends, everyone opens their gifts and shares a laugh over the gag items.
- **Fair Play:** Encourage a spirit of fun and fairness â€“ the goal is laughter and surprise!
- **Adaptability:** Feel free to tweak the rules to suit the size and preferences of your group. 

Enjoy your Uncle Nick style White Elephant game!
